Disclaimer:  
I used Katalon Studio. It has 30 day free trial. After 30 days, it will downgrade to community edition but still usable. 
I couldn’t automate the captcha. Ideally we disable it on lower environment during automation since main purpose of captcha is to avoid bots to try login the system.
